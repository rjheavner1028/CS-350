# CS-350

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
With an emphasis on connecting various hardware elements, including sensors and peripherals, to a thermostat system, the projects were created to investigate hardware-software integration. The objective was to develop a job scheduler that managed events in real time while managing hardware elements such as temperature sensors, buttons, and LEDs. Through the use of interfaces like GPIO, SPI, and I2C, this project effectively managed and coordinated a number of hardware peripherals.

What did you do particularly well?
I was really good at making the task scheduler, which made sure that things like temperature checks, LED updates, and UART data transfer all happened smoothly. I also successfully incorporated the hardware components into the system and showed that I understood how to use various interfaces.

Where could you improve?
I could have improved making sure my code matched perfectly with the needs of the assignment.

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
I think having the TI-Board can be helpful in the future.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or coursework?
Working with various hardware interfaces (GPIO, SPI, I2C), developing effective job schedulers, and guaranteeing seamless software-hardware connection will all be highly transferable to future projects, particularly those involving embedded programming and real-time systems.

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
By using modular code and providing thorough documentation to my assignments, I was able to make the project maintainable.
